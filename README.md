# phpmyadmin
Phpmyadmin plugin system and demo plugin displaying foreign keys in the table structure

Loose-integrated plugin system for phpmyadmin.
Incipient development stage created for personal purposes.

The original ideea was to be able to do an alteration to phpmyadmin to allow the viewing of foreign keys in the table structure.
The end result was a lightweight plugin system which is in a "functional" state but needs much work to be able to accomodate different kind of plugins.
